Project Name- MALNUTRITION ASSESSMENT

         An attempt to identify malnutrition like IUGR , MARASMUS and KWASHIORKOR using machine learning.
         
        
DATASET:
        
        Dataset named pem.csv which was created by me, contains 13 attributes(13 column) which intern helps to find out the malnutrition.
        
        The attributes are -  1.id
                              2.age_inmonths
                              3.birth_weight

        7.phychomotor_changes - behaviuoral changes, it can be, i)irritable - 
                                                                ii)lethargic - feeling dull in all the activities.

        8.serum_albumin_level - it measures the amount of protein in individuals blood. It can vary from 3.4 to 5.4g/dL.
        
        9.abdomen - it access the abdomenal changes, it can be, i)distended - abdomen swollen.
                                                                ii)normal - abdomen normal.
                                                              
        10.organomegaly - here we access major abdomenal organs including spleen, liver, kidney etc., it can be, i)yes - increased in size
                                                                                                                 ii)no - normal.
                                                                                                                 
        11.subcutaneous_fat - fatty tissue present beneath the skin. here we are accessing subcutaneous fat using calipers, usually it is accessed between the age group of 0-10                               age and its values varies from 0 to 30.
        
        12.present_weight - present weight of the individual.
        
        13.diagnosis - 
                      
                     a) IUGR - It stands for intra uterine growth retardation. It refers to a condition in which an unborn baby is smaller than it should be because it is not                                  growing at a normal rate inside the womb. First 50 entries in dataset denotes IUGR i.e fron id 1 to 50. The main parameter to identify this                                      malnutrition is the birth weight, which will be below 2.5. 
                     
                     b)MERASMUS - It is a form of malnutrition. It happens when the intake of nutrients and energy is too low for a personâ€™s needs. It leads to wasting, or                                         the loss of body fat and muscle. A child with marasmus may not grow as children usually do. Next 50 entries denotes MERASMUS i.e from id 51 to                                   100. The parameter to identify this malnutrition will be
                     
                     c)KWASHIORKOR - It is a malnutrition produced by a severely inadequate amount of protein in the diet.
